                <p>Suguru, explain yourself. You already heard it from Shoko. That’s all there is to it, Satoru. So you’re just going to kill every non-sorcerer… and your parents? I can’t allow my parents to be a special exception. Besides, I don't consider those people my family anymore. That’s not what I was asking you. I thought we weren’t allowed to kill when there’s no point to it! There is a point, and a cause, and a significance to it. No there’s not! You’re really going to kill all non-Jujutsu sorcerer’s now? You know that’s impossible! There’s no point in chipping away at something you can’t possibly achieve! You’re so arrogant. Huh?! You could do it yourself, Satoru, couldn’t you? Yet you would try to convince someone else that it’s impossible to do something which is possible for you. Do you think you’re the strongest because you’re Satoru Gojo, or are you Satoru Gojo because you’re the strongest? Just what are you trying to say? If I were able to become you for a moment, this foolish idea would become a lot more grounded and real, don’t you think? Tch… I’ve made my decision. Now it’s just a matter of doing the best I can to achieve it. If you want to kill me then kill me. There would be a point to that.</p>
